# US_Partisanship_Analysis

This is a project from Stat 302. In this project, we explored U.S. Congress voting data from [voteview.com](https://voteview.com). We used SVD analysis to examine the partisanship of U.S.Congress. The data that we examined were [90th House of Representatives](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bryandmartin/STAT302/master/docs/Projects/project2_svd/house_90_raw.csv), [90th Senate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bryandmartin/STAT302/master/docs/Projects/project2_svd/senate_90_raw.csv), [116th House of Representatives](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bryandmartin/STAT302/master/docs/Projects/project2_svd/house_116_raw.csv), [116th Senate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bryandmartin/STAT302/master/docs/Projects/project2_svd/senate_116_raw.csv). Note that in our analysis, blue represents the vote from Democrates, red represents the vote from Republicans, and green represents the vote from Independents. We hope this analysis can help people to better understand the U.S. partisanship from different aspects through visualizations and SVD analysis.
